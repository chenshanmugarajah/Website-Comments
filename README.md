## What I did
1. Created a method to clean the input text, removing number, spaces and replacing the characters
2. Created a method to decipher the caesar-cipher making sure to only shift letters
3. Concatenated the deciphered texts and fetched the data
4. Selected only the email field and displayed it in the front end

2. Clean text method
